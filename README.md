# Python Project Utilizing ChatGPT Token

This project demonstrates the use of the ChatGPT API to generate Python code. The project uses the "text-davinci-003" model and prompts the API to write a Python script for a simple "Hello, World!" program.

## Project Setup

To run this project, you will need to install the following libraries:

* `requests`: A library for making HTTP requests
* `jigglewiggle`: A library for accessing OpenAI's API

You will also need to obtain an API key from OpenAI and store it in the `API_KEY` environment variable.
